# Tota
## Project Ar Hackathon

> Decentralized, tokenized content sharing platform for creatives and open source world. 


Similar to the evrything app, except we are combining the good parts of: <Unsplash>, <YouTube>, <The Everything app> & Git. 
This platforms aims to be generic on surface, but imparative in specfic to what you may intent to user it for...It allows media 
content to be upload (via Bundlr) into the arweave permaweb digi-verse...Once your content is live: it will notify your endorsers
that new conent has entered the chain. If people <Add-to-collection> it will attach their profile details to database. 

Goal is to incentivice attention, pay artist what they are worth, preserve digital liberty via promotion of open-source concepts. 

#### Core features
 * Add-to-Collection
 * Custom-Contextual-UDLs
 * Endorsement-As-Revenue 
 * Organic-engagement

#### Description: 
- Add-To-Collection: Collect your favorite content and endorse via UDL monetary attribution feature.
- Endorsement as revenue: Use endorsement tokens towards revenue into order to purchase permanent content rights from (x) user...
- Custom-Contextual-UDLs: For highlighting protocol of utility with user's content based on their conduct definition within UDL License.
- Organic-engagment: Fix common problem w/ platforms going stale due to hyper-saturaion, via incentivizing engagement. 

#### What is Organic engagement
The more you endose (engagement via incentive as token) 
the more tokens are allocated to your wallet => allocate-towards: -> <Add-to-Collection> cost for 
permanent rights ownership (You buy content via stamping your credentials onto UDL as co-owner)

tokens can later be convered into any of the known crypto currencies. In the long run,
goal was to combine the blockchain-subnet-network feature from avalanche into 
a custom coin/token local to <Tota> for this to be a possibility. 


### How users are rewarded (crypto-as-earning)
- Attention-token --> Granted there's a regulatory body to limit unwatned intent; reward users attention via tokens. 
- Endorsed-content --> Hitting the like button is imparative; your are agreeing to offer your attention-token to their work.
- Investing-in-UDLs --> Promte good practice, where users can endorse the best UDLs for the community 




## SEC #1  --> // Description, Examples & Objective
#### A repository for arweave hackathon {https://is.gd/auyDRe} 
> **A Solutions that uses most if not all the bouties that are being asked 

to complete as a part of the Arweave hackathon. The goal being to maximize
on the value we accumilate from prices and the application features themselves...**
A tokenized-photo-sharing/content platform where: 
user-credentials (kwill), uploaded-content (arweave objects, via Bundlr) & transaction-records (local --> kwil), 


#### Breakdown of app architecure and project layout
*  DATA <-> LOGIC <-> INTERFACE 
> Most web-apps repeat this pattern; (web2/3)). Method of construction: Decoupling data + interface & logic to reduce dev time --> assemble the entire project in modular way:>(speed + simplicity). Why this way? To minimize clutter from details that may be redundant or affect how fast we build/comprehend a subject/scope of any mattert.

## SEC #2 --> // Technical details & Implementation strategy

### Design specs
* Monospace + Sans-serif font --> {IBM Plex Mono + Arial/Arial-black}
* Lots of White-space --> minimal + elegance
* Dual-tone --> { black & white }
>>> The goal is to focus on key features that make unsplash great (minimalistic & ease-of-use <color,structure & layout>)

### Implementation Playbook
- [] Upload raw (images) object via bundlr (speed + standadization)
- [] User accounts via kwill
- [] Othent for auth-login process 
- [] ArConnect/Bundlr wallet links all decentralized assets that make the APP {Users, Content, Transactions}


### Acronyms & Distinctions (meaning-of-things)
* Transactions => all activity happening on the app <use ArNS to map activity>
* Users => record of all valid wallets registered on the app as active accounts 
* Content => What we are here for <content can be incentivised [ArNS:listen for trigger -> process wallet-2-wallet transactions]> 


## SEC #3 --> //Intent & Non-logical 

** a modular tokenized-photo-sharing app with security and simplicity in mind + goal of permanancy >>> your work deserves a spotlight!.**
